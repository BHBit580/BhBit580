# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ujjawal Saini

🎮 **Unity Game Developer** | 🧠 Passionate about gameplay mechanics, performance, and creating fun from scratch!

With hands-on experience in mobile game development and internships at studios like **Audify**, **Flying Ant Studios**, and more, I've worked on successful published titles such as **Bus Jam (100K+ installs)** and **Tile Match (50K+ installs)**. I love diving deep into systems and bringing ideas to life with great player feel.

## 🌟 What Sets Me Apart:

🚀 **Fast Learner & Builder:**  
I prototype fast, take feedback quickly, and love making systems that scale.

💬 **Team Contributor:**  
In every internship, I’ve added real value, shipping to thousands of users, and learning from live projects.


## 📚 Currently Exploring:
- **VR, Unreal Engine (UEFN)**, and **Roblox** for the next level of immersive gameplay.
- Building a personal brand by posting case studies and breakdowns on LinkedIn.
