# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ujjawal Saini

🎮 **Unity Game Developer** | 🧠 Passionate about gameplay systems, performance, and creating fun from scratch!

With hands-on experience in mobile game development and internships at studios like **Audify**, **Flying Ant Studios**, and more, I've worked on successful published titles such as **Bus Jam (100K+ installs)** and **Tile Match (50K+ installs)**. I love diving deep into systems, optimizing code, and bringing ideas to life with great player feel.

## 💼 Key Expertise:

🛠️ **Game Development:**  
From puzzle games to shooters, I build polished, modular, and optimized games using Unity, and now exploring Unreal & Roblox too.

🧠 **Programming & Architecture:**  
Strong grip over **C#**, clean code, **State Machines**, **ScriptableObjects**, and performance optimization — especially for WebGL and mobile.

🎨 **Creative Systems & UI:**  
Built modular UI systems, dynamic water pipes, cinematic camera shots, and engaging feedback using **DOTween**, **FEEL**, and **post-processing**.

## 🌟 What Sets Me Apart:

🚀 **Fast Learner & Builder:**  
I prototype fast, take feedback quickly, and love making systems that scale.

💬 **Team Contributor:**  
In every internship, I’ve added real value — cutting build sizes by 70%, shipping to thousands of users, and learning from live projects.

💡 **Innovative Mindset:**  
One of my games was inspired by a dream — and I built it for an IGDC jam!
